# 2. Learning Outcomes:
Please note this is not the assessment task. The task to be completed is detailed on the next page.

This CA will assess student attainment of the following minimum intended learning outcomes:

## 2.1. Programming for DA

3. Critically appraise aggregation methods to process and manipulate data from multiple data structures. (Linked to  Programme Learning Outcome (PLO) 3).

4. Formulate and evaluate a test and optimisation strategy for programmatic solutions. (Linked to PLO 5).

## 2.2. Statistics for Data Analytics

1. Explore and evaluate datasets using descriptive statistical analyses (PLO 1)

3. Apply statistical analysis to appropriate datasets and critique the limitations of these models (PLO 2,4)

## 2.3. Machine Learning for Data Analysis

2. Determine whether a given data analysis problem requires the use of supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised learning methods. Develop and implement the chosen learning method. (Linked to PLO 1, PLO 2, PLO 4)

3. Implement a range of classification and regression techniques and detail / document their suitability for a variety of problem domains. (Linked to PLO 5)

4. Critically evaluate the performance of Machine Learning models, propose strategies to optimise performance. (Linked to PLO 3)

## 2.4. Data Preparation & Visualisation

1. Discuss the concepts, techniques and processes underlying data visualisation to critically evaluate visualisation approaches with respect to their suitability for different problem areas. (linked to PLO 1).

3. Engineer new features selection in data with the goal of improving the performance of machine learning models. (linked to PLO 2, PLO 4)



>Attainment of the learning outcomes is the minimum requirement to achieve a **Pass mark (40%)**. Higher marks are awarded where there is evidence of achievement beyond this, in accordance with QQI Assessment and Standards, Revised 2013, and summarised in the following table:

|Percentage Range|QQI Description of Attainment|
|----------------|----------------|
|70% +          |Achievement includes that required for a Pass and in most respects is significantly and consistently beyond this|
|60 – 69%       |Achievement includes that required for a Pass and in many respects is significantly beyond this|
|40 – 59%       |Attains all the minimum intended programme learning outcomes|
|35 – 39%       |Nearly (but not quite) attains the relevant minimum intended learning outcomes|
|0 – 34%        |Does not attain some or all of the minimum intended learning outcomes|

>Level 9 awards

The CCT Grade Descriptor describes the standard of work for grade boundaries summarised below. The full descriptor is available on Moodle.

|Grade|90-100%|80-89%|70-79%|60-69%|50-59%|40-49%|35-39%|<35%|

# 3. Assessment Task
Students are advised to review and adhere to the submission requirements documented after the assessment task.

## 3.1. Scenario: Transport and Infrastructure
A large amount of data has been collected by Dublin City Council (DCC) regarding Transport and Infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, This data is available at:

[Dublin City Council - Transport and Infrastructure](https://data.gov.ie/organization/dublin-city-council?tags=Transport+and+Infrastructure)


You are required to choose a particular area of interest and formulate the appropriate questions for modeling and analysis. For Example (but not limited to):

* Clamping Appeals
* Multistorey Car Parking Space Availability
* Telecoms Underground Infrastructure DCC
* etc…


**You are required to collect, process, analyse and interpret the data** in order to identify possible issues/ problems at present and make predictions/ classifications in regards to the future. _This analysis will rely on the available data from DCC and any additional data you deem necessary (with supporting evidence)_ to support your hypothesis for this scenario. 

This will require you to employ critical analysis of not only the domain of choice but also for the regression and or classification that you undertake.

>**Note: This is an academic exercise and not a hypothetical report to DCC**

# 4. Criteria of Analysis

## 4.1. Statistics: (Graded out of 100)

   - [ ] You are required to plot at least two graphs.
1. Discrete distribution [0-30]:
   - [ ] Use at least one discrete distribution (Binomial/Poisson) to explain/identify some information about your data. 
2. Use at least one Normal Distribution [0-30]
   - [ ] to explain/identify some information about your data. 
   - [ ] You must justify the use of the measures you calculated and the techniques you used.
   - [ ] You are allowed to work with Python, but your mathematical reasoning must be documented in your report


## 4.2. Data preparation and Visualization : (Graded out of 100)

1. Exploratory Data Analysis EDA `[0-30]`
   - [ ] You must perform appropriate EDA on your dataset
   - [ ] rationalizing and detailing why you chose the specific methods
   - [ ] and what insight you gained.
2. Prepare data for ML `[0-20]`
   - [ ] You must also rationalise and detail all the methods used to prepare the data for ML.
3. Visualizations `[0-30]`
   - [ ] Appropriate visualizations must be used to engender insight into the dataset and to illustrate your final insights gained in your analysis. 
4. Visualizations justification `[0-20]`
